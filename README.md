# Facebook Management System

> A simulation of Facebook’s core functionality using Object-Oriented Programming principles in Java.

## 📌 Overview

This project mimics Facebook's backend logic for managing users, posts, friendships, and private messaging — all built from scratch using core OOP concepts. It also supports persistent file storage and user interaction through the console.

## 🧠 Features

- User registration and login with credentials validation
- Post creation with privacy settings (Public/Friends-only)
- Commenting and replying to posts/comments
- Friend requests, mutual friends/posts detection
- Operators `+` and `&` overloaded for mutual content
- Messaging system between users
- Restricted vs. regular friend access
- Role-based friend visibility and trust scores
- File-based storage and retrieval of data
- Full exception handling

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- Java
- OOP (Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation, Abstraction)
- UML Class Diagrams
- File I/O
- Exception Handling

## 🧩 Core Classes

- `User`
- `FriendShip`
- `Post`, `Comment`, `Reply`
